# connect-four

This is a Connect Four game I created in my EECS 285 class, Fall 2016. <br>
This class introduced me to Java programming. <br>
Coding language is Java, I make use of Java's API.

### Lessons: <br>
This is the first project I've made that makes use of a server. <br>
We did this so you are able to simulate a multiplayer game, and play locally. <br>
Note: This game is not flawless, there are some outcomes that are incorrect.

### Extras: <br>
For extra credit, I added in a chat box. 

### Controls: <br>
Clicking on the square places your chip. <br>
You can only play when it is your turn.

### Files: <br>
ConnectFour.java - The main file that contains all of Connect Four's gameplay. <br>
Player1Demo.java - I used this to test playing the game. <br>
Player2Demo.java - I used this to test multiplayer and play against myself, with the Player1Demo. <br>
PlayerSocket.java - This created the server, so the players were able to communicate.
